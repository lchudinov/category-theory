### 1. Graph with one node and no edges
- **Nodes**: Just one node, let's call it `•`.
- **Edges**: None.

**Free Category**:
- **Objects**: `{•}`
- **Morphisms**: Only the identity morphism `id_•` (since there are no edges to form any paths).
- **Composition**: Trivially, `id_• ∘ id_• = id_•`.

This is the trivial category with one object and only the identity morphism.

### 2. Graph with one node and one (directed) edge
- **Nodes**: One node, `•`.
- **Edges**: One edge, let's call it `f : • → •`.

**Free Category**:
- **Objects**: `{•}`
- **Morphisms**: All possible paths formed by `f` and the identity:
  - `id_•` (the empty path),
  - `f`,
  - `f ∘ f` (often written `f^2`),
  - `f ∘ f ∘ f` (`f^3`),
  - and so on, for all finite powers of `f`.
- **Composition**: Concatenation of paths, e.g., `f^n ∘ f^m = f^{n+m}`.

This is isomorphic to the monoid of natural numbers under addition (if we ignore `id_•` as the "empty path"), or the monoid `(ℕ, +)`.

### 3. Graph with two nodes and a single arrow between them
- **Nodes**: Two nodes, say `A` and `B`.
- **Edges**: One edge, `f : A → B`.

**Free Category**:
- **Objects**: `{A, B}`
- **Morphisms**:
  - Identity morphisms: `id_A : A → A`, `id_B : B → B`.
  - The edge `f : A → B`.
  - No other paths exist (since you can't compose `f` with anything else, as there are no edges whose domain is `B` or codomain is `A`).
- **Composition**: The only non-trivial composition is `id_B ∘ f = f` and `f ∘ id_A = f`.

This is the free category generated by the graph, which is just the graph itself with identities added and the minimal necessary compositions.

### 4. Graph with a single node and 26 arrows marked with the letters of the alphabet
- **Nodes**: One node, `•`.
- **Edges**: 26 edges, say `a, b, c, ..., z : • → •`.

**Free Category**:
- **Objects**: `{•}`
- **Morphisms**: All possible finite sequences (words) formed by composing the edges, including the empty sequence (identity):
  - `id_•` (empty word),
  - All single-letter words: `a, b, c, ..., z`,
  - All two-letter words: `aa, ab, ac, ..., az, ba, bb, ..., zz`,
  - And so on, for all finite combinations of the letters.
- **Composition**: Concatenation of words, e.g., `abc ∘ def = abcdef`.

This is isomorphic to the free monoid on 26 generators (the letters of the alphabet), where the monoid operation is concatenation. In other words, the morphisms are all possible words over the alphabet `{a, b, ..., z}`, with composition given by word concatenation.

### Summary:
1. Trivial category (one object, only identity).
2. Monoid of natural numbers under addition (one object, morphisms are powers of `f`).
3. Two objects with one morphism between them (and identities).
4. Free monoid on 26 generators (one object, morphisms are words over the alphabet).
